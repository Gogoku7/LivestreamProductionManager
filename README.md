# Livestream Production Manager

An ASP.NET MVC application to manage the overlay of any fighting game for Tournament streams!

This project is to help tournament streamers that are just starting out.

Livestream Production Manager can be deployed to IIS. When deployed to IIS, change the BaseUrl AppSetting to 'localhost' or 'localhost/livestreamproductionmanager' (depending on which url Livestream Production Manager runs) in the Web.config of the application and the baseUrl variable in FightingGames/SuperSmashBros/JavaScript/OverlayManager.js to ensure the WebSocket connection to work.

To learn how to enable IIS, use: https://www.itnota.com/install-iis-windows/ Deploying to IIS and running can be done manually or using Visual Studio tools.
